Code,Name,Description
COMP 1805,Discrete Structures I,"Introduction to discrete mathematics and discrete structures. Topics include: propositional logic, predicate calculus, set theory, complexity of algorithms, mathematical reasoning and proof techniques, recurrences, induction, finite automata and graph theory. Material is illustrated through examples from computing."
COMP 2402,Abstract Data Types and Algorithms,"Introduction to the design and implementation of abstract data types and to complexity analysis of data structures. Topics include: stacks, queues, lists, trees and graphs. Special attention is given to abstraction, interface specification and hierarchical design using an object-oriented programming language."
COMP 2804,Discrete Structures II,"A second course in discrete mathematics and discrete structures. Topics include: counting, sequences and sums, discrete probability, basic statistics, recurrence relations, randomized algorithms. Material is illustrated through examples from computing."
COMP 3804,Design and Analysis of Algorithms I,"An introduction to the design and analysis of algorithms. Topics include: divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, linear programming, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, NP-completeness."
