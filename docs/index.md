# [**CodeQuest**](https://codequest.cublueprint.org) Event Planning

## Event Title

**^^CodeQuest 2024: Algorithm Visualization Challenge^^** (AlgoViz)

## The Challenge

Participants are asked to create a graphically engaging animation to visualize an algorithm of their choosing.
Here is a [a set of suggested algorithms](#algorithms) as an inspiration for what participants can choose from *(or not. If you have a better algo, use that!)*

They will be judged on the quality of their visualization and the correctness or complexity of their implementation.

### Algorithms


Some preliminary ideas (to be majorly refined):

COMP 1805
:   - Breadth First Search

COMP 2402
:   - Heapify
    - Array Mutation

COMP 2804
:   - 00-free bitstrings
    - Group into 2 sets

COMP 3804
:   - Kruskal's/Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
    - Dijsktra's Algorithm (Shortest Path)
    - Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

!!! note "Faculty Involvement"
    - Consider the possibility of involving faculty members and professors in the challenge creation or in the wider event.

### Suggested Technologies

### Algorithm Sources

Algorithms will be drawn from the following list of courses:

{{ read_csv("cu_classes.csv") }}

Additional detail about these courses can be found on [Carleton's Undergraduate Computer Science Courses page](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/computerscience/).

!!! info "A note on difficulty levels"
    When selecting algorithms, be judicious to select those that are **inclusive** and **approachable** *(especially for lower-year students)* but not trivial--they should be challenging enough to require some thought and **creativity** to visualize.
