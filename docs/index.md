# CodeQuest 2024: AlgoViz Edition for CUSEC

## Event Title

**^^CodeQuest 2024: Algorithm Visualization Challenge^^**

## The Challenge

Participants are asked to create a graphically engaging animation to visualize an algorithm of their choosing.
Here is a [a set of suggested algorithms](#algorithms) as an inspiration for what participants can choose from *(or not. If you have better algos, use those instead!)*.

Visualizations may be **interactive** or **non-interactive** (video form), and may be created using any programming language or tool of the participant's choice. Participants may elect to include a voiceover to explain their visualization, but this is optional.

Submissions be judged on the quality and intuitiveness of their visualization and the correctness/complexity of their implementation.

### Suggested Technologies

<!-- ### Algorithm Sources

Algorithms will be drawn from the following list of courses:

{{ read_csv("cu_classes.csv") }} -->

<!-- Additional detail about these courses can be found on [Carleton's Undergraduate Computer Science Courses page](https://calendar.carleton.ca/undergrad/undergradprograms/computerscience/).

!!! info "A note on difficulty levels"
    When selecting algorithms, be judicious to select those that are **inclusive** and **approachable** *(especially for lower-year students)* but not trivial--they should be challenging enough to require some thought and **creativity** to visualize. -->
